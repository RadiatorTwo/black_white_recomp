# PLAN — Black & White recompile

## Done

- 2026-11-04: Disc analysis: InstallShield 6 cabs, SafeDisc 2 on both retail EXEs; patch 1.42
  gives an unprotected `runblack.exe`.
- 2026-11-04: Game folder without the installer: `iso.rs`, `iscab.rs`, `setup.rs`,
  `examples/install.rs`. Output `game_files/BlackWhite` (980 files, 491 MB), MD5 of every cab
  file checked.

- 2026-11-04: Recompiler core from rustschweine; `game.rs` loads runblack.exe + 9 DLLs.
  35,025 functions found, all compiled, 97 with unsupported instructions (CLAUDE.md, "The
  code"). `SELFMOD` analysed: only `sub_fc1285` is reachable (stores pitches); the rest,
  with its opcode rewriting, is dead code here.

## Next

1. MMX (binkw32, QMixer) and SSE (EXE): lift MMX or report no MMX; check the game's CPU check.
2. Platform layer from rustschweine (`src/platform/`, `main.rs`): start the game, list the
   imports actually called, start with kernel32/user32/ddraw.
3. Registry keys and config the setup writes (`SETUP.INX`, `Setup.exe` of patch 1.42).

## Later

- Creature Isle: `CreatureIsle.exe` is SafeDisc 2.51; needs an unprotected EXE or our own
  decryption. Installs to `<TARGETDIR>\CreatureIsle`.
